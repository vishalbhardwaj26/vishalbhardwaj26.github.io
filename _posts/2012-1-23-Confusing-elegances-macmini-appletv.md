Is apple TV another version of Mac mini or Is Apple TV subset of Mac mini?
Can I set up development environment on Mac mini ?
Can we do computer like operation on Apple TV?

So here is small effort to put some introduction/differences on the mentioned products:

**Mac Mini**(starts at $599): Apple's Mac mini was introduced in January 2005 , fully featured computer but is squeezed into a small form factor (16.5 x16.5 x 5.1 cm) with a weighs just 1.31 kg.

So yes, Mac mini is just like other computer and can be used for iphone/other development. Apart from the services offered by Apple TV, Mac Mini offers more functionality and more performance.  

Apple TV have a small 8 GB flash drive and that is only for OS purpose, which limit us to stream music, video and movies. Also, inability to hook up an external drive limits the user for various functionalities in Apple TV. But both the device can stream the data(video,music etc) online so Apple TV can use iCloud or some other device and eliminate the need of more storage. Also interface on the Apple TV is so much more intuitive there really is no comparison when it comes to a media centre scenario. And with a new release, Along with blockbuster  movies, TV shows, News,  music, photos, Sports, Apple TV can easily access to your previously purchased TV shows stored in iCloud (release with iOS5). With powerful A4 chip, Apple TV plays everything effortlessly, without frozen screens or stutters. Videos look crisp and clear. And just like watching a DVD, you can fast-forward through opening credits, pause for a popcorn break, or replay a hilarious scene until you memorize every line. You cannot rent HD movies on any other device other than the Apple TV. The mini is simply not an alternative if you want to do this. I will not go in detail but Air Play, AirPlay Mirroring and Photo stream are some of the advance features of Apple TV.
