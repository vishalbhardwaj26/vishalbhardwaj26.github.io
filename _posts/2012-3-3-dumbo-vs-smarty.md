title: Dumbo vs Smarty... 
---

(Dumbness are still preferable)

I just switched my mobility from very basic Motorola w230 to smart Galaxy ace. No need to count number of features available on smart phone, but simplicity and couple of attributes of my not-so-smart Motorola  are missing from the smart world, for which  I would still prefer dumbphones over smarties here.

In addition to low weight and low cost, basic phones have some more edges over smart phones:

* **Battery Life**: Smart phone takes long to charge and runs not even for a day to support so many features.

* **Complexities**: I had one click action in receving and two step action in dialling on my basic  motorola,  Whereas smart phone needs a long swype on screen to receive and 4 step action to dial anybody from phone book excluding skype option to chose at the end. It was only one example and you can find the similar experience while doing text messaging. So using smart phone is bit frustrating for generation believes in doing simple things. Actually older generation does not want so many features and still using phone only to place and receive a call.

* **Data Loss**: No doubt Smart phone offers capabilities to logged into our various accounts (social networking, Mailbox, Bank accounts etc) any time, any place, but it makes them source for data loss. Phones are more prone to theft or can be easily misplaced, which could cause huge loss of our personnal information. So we should either make them password protected or buy some good anti-theft features to keep the information safe.

* **Virus Threats**: Smart Phones are like mini computer and need Antivirus to protect your system from many online viruses and threats.

* **Touch Screens**: Using touch screens (on screen keyboard) on smart world are very trendy in younger generation but not so easy and even frustrating for people with low eyesight and unstable with their hands.

*  **Work-Life Balance**: Smart phones are becoming big intruders in your personal life and very much disturbing the work-life balance. Unlike your personal computer/laptop, Smart phones are always in touch and keep you online from any place, which allows others to interact with you anytime. So you will have to mark a prominent line between your online presence and personal life to make your life gadget free and have some time to rest and to devote with your family.

* **Tracking**: Smart phone allows people to be tracked through many application in some or other way. So it could be +/- for you, if you want or no to be.

So, the solely suggestion is to learn and use your smart phone in a smart way and keep the device in your control instead of keeping your life in gadget's control.
